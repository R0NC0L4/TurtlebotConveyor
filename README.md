This project aims to provide a guide for setting up and moving the TurtleBot3 Conveyor, a mobile robot with four wheels and four joints.

The robot can move thanks to 8 DYNAMIXEL XL430-W250-T servomotors (4 for steering and 4 for driving) which are connected to an OpenCR1.0 Board.  Communication with the Arduino Board can be done via a joystick using the RC100 remote control with BT410 master-slave Bluetooth modules or via a Raspberry Pi 4 using ROS. We're going to explain both ways.
